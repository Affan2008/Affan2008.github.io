<p class="m"><b>Linux</b></p>
<p>Linux (also called "GNU/Linux") is a free and open-source operating system kernel. It was started as a personal project in 1991 by Linus Trovalds. A Linux distribution (often also called as "distro") is an operating system made from a collection of softwares (including the Linux kernel). Most distributions also includes a package manager (such as dpkg for Debian-based distros, rpm for Red Hat Linux-based distros and pacman for Arch-based distros) which allows users to install additional software into an existing distribution.</p>
